# Foundations of Numerical Computing

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/master)

This repository contains lecture slides, exercises, and deployment scripts for
**Foundations of Numerical Computing**, a tutorial given by Scott Sanderson at
PyCon 2018.

You try the lecture and exercise notebooks on [binder](https://mybinder.org/)
by clicking the button above.

The materials in this repository are organized as follows:

- [Lecture.ipynb](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/0-Lecture.ipynb)
  contains the notebook used by the presenter during the lecture sections of
  the tutorial.

- [Finding Functions and
  Documentation.ipynb](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/1-Finding%20Functions%20and%20Documentation%20in%20Jupyter.ipynb)
  is a notebook used as a warmup exercise to get students comfortable with
  Jupyter. It shows you how to use `np.lookfor` to search Numpy by keyword, and
  it shows you how to read function documentation using Jupyter's `?` operator.

- [Creating and Reshaping
  Arrays](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/2-Creating%20and%20Reshaping%20Arrays.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to create and reshape arrays.

- [Universal Functions](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/3-Universal%20Functions.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to use Numpy's universal functions.

- [Selections](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/4-Selections.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to use the ndarray `[]` operator
  to select data.

- [Reductions](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/5-Reductions.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to apply reduction functions like
  `min`, `max`, and `min` across arrays.

- [Broadcasting](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/6-Broadcasting.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to use broadcasting in conjunction
  with the other techniques shown during the tutorial.

Each notebook also has an associated (Solutions) notebook that contains worked
solutions for each of the exercises.
