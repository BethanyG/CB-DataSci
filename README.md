Welcome to Jupyter notebook on Glitch
========================================

It turns out you can run Juypter on Glitch!


### Running this

You can run juypter in Glitch, if you [set a token with the JUPYTER_TOKEN environment variable](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/2921/).

To do this, you need to set the token in the `.env` file in Glitch.


```
JUPYTER_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

```

If you try viewing the site, you'll also be prompted for a token/password to add in.

Add the token you set in `.env`, and voila! You have a jupyter notebook available to play with.
